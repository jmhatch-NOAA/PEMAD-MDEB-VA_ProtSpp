# Introduction

The increasing demand for renewable energy is driving offshore wind (OSW) development in the United States (US) at an unprecedented rate. The US has a target to reach 30 GW by 2030, with an additional 15 GW from floating substructures by 2035, and aims to produce at least 110 GW by 2050.

However, OSW development in the US Greater Atlantic Region (GAR) coincides with significant proportions of marine mammal and sea turtle populations, with impacts from OSW farms being a major concern.

## Vulnerability assessment

A vulnerability assessment is a general method to determine the vulnerability of protected species to OSW development and what factors could be contributing to that vulnerability.

The Offshore Wind Vulnerability Assessment (OSWVA) was designed in a similar way to the Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Climate Vulnerability Assessments (MM- and STCVAs) by using an expert-based scoring approach. Experts will be asked to score multiple features for two separate components: 1) overlap or exposure to factors related to offshore wind development (ie, exposure factors) and 2) sensitivity to those exposure factors. 

### Vulnerability outcomes

- Serious injury / mortality
    - Noise
      - Distance to sound source
    - Vessel strike
      - Vessel speed and approach
      - Ability to detect and then avoid a vessel, if possible
    - Indirect (knock-on) effects to prey or habitat
    - Avoidance
- Sub-lethal effects / morbidity
- Behavioral disruptions
- Displacement
    - Avoidance
    - Habitat limited / flexible

## Scope

### Geographic
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
# load libraries
library(leaflet)

# data
sne = '../data/sne_region.shp' |>
  sf::st_read(quiet = TRUE)
mari = '../data/mari_weas.gpkg' |>
  sf::st_read(quiet = TRUE)

# add data
map = leaflet(width = '100%') |>
  addTiles() |>
  addPolygons(data = sne, fillColor = 'transparent', color = 'black', popup = ~REGION) |>
  addPolygons(data = mari, popup = ~LEASENM)
map
```

### Species

- [North Atlantic right whale](#north-atlantic-right-whale)
- Humpback whale
- Harbor porpoise
- Grey seal
- Leatherback turtle

## CVAs

Overviews of the MMCVAs were taken from [Lettrich et al. (2023)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0290643).
