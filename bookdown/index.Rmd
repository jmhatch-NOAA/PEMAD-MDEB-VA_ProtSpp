# Introduction

The increasing demand for renewable energy is driving offshore wind development in the United States (US) at an unprecedented rate. The US has a target to reach 30 GW by 2030, with an additional 15 GW from floating substructures by 2035, and aims to produce at least 110 GW by 2050.

However, OSW development in the US Greater Atlantic Region (GAR) coincides with significant proportions of marine mammal and sea turtle populations, with impacts from OSW farms being a major concern.

Overviews of marine mammal stock climate vulnerability analyses were taken from [Lettrich et al. (2023)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0290643).
