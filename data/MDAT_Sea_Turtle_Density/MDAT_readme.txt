Zip files are available for download as follows:
*  Avian relative density products for individual species
*  Avian species group relative abundance summary products (There are no diversity products for
	avian species groups.  See MDAT-Technical-Report.pdf for more details.)
*  Fish individual species products for NEFSC trawl data source
*  Fish species group summary products for the NEFSC trawl data source
*  Marine mammal density products for individual species
*  Marine mammal species group summary products
*  Sea turtle density products for individual species


At the top level of this zip file, there are documents with details on the background and
development of the contained data.
*  MDAT-Technical-Report.pdf - Detailed report of MDAT data products for all taxa (avian, fish, marine mammals).
*  *_Model_Technical_Report.pdf - detailed report about individual species model creation
*  *_Metadata.pdf - Collection level metadata for this specific data set.
*  *_Release_Notes.txt - Documentation on changes since the last MDAT data update.


All raster data files may be accessed directly from the "commondata" subdirectories, or via the
contained ArcGIS Pro 2.x *.mapx map file in the "esri_mapfile" subdirectory.  These map files contain all of the
raster data, grouped by individual species or species group, with appropriate symbology, and are
compatible with all 2.x and subsequent versions of ESRI ArcGIS Pro.

Accessing the ArcGIS Pro *.mapx map file first will aid the user in understanding the files contained in the
"commondata" subdirectories.  However, all raster files are clearly named for users of non-ESRI mapping
programs.
